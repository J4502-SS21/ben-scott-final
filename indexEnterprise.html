  <p class="text-first"><a class="dropcap">E</a>nterprise, Louisiana is an incorporated community that sits in Catahoula Parish. The community gained widespread media attention for its eye-catching images of brown contaminated water coming from hoses and taps.</p>
  <p>Prior to the media focus, one report from Virginia Tech said its team couldn’t even find the community on Google Maps.</p>
  <p>Catahoula Parish, the parish containing Enterprise, is a sparsely populated rural parish, with a total population estimate of 9,494 people. Over a quarter of the population lives in poverty, far above the 19% of Louisiana’s population living in poverty and even further above the 10% of the entire United States living in poverty.</p>
  <p>The Baton Rouge Advocate reported that when the Louisiana governor’s office investigated 10 of the worst water systems in the state, it found a common thread linking most of the systems together: aging infrastructure along with lacking funds.</p>
  <p>The report continued to say that a majority of dilapidated and dangerous water systems are found in rural communities, such as Enterprise. As more residents leave these small communities, they have less taxpayer dollars to support and fix infrastructure projects. </p>
  <p>The report continued to say that a majority of dilapidated and dangerous water systems are found in rural communities, such as Enterprise. As more residents leave these small communities, they have less taxpayer dollars to support and fix infrastructure projects. </p>
  <p>Thus, when Virginia Tech’s team behind the U.S. Water Study rolled into Enterprise, its findings were hardly surprising. The team’s report said it initially visited the town after Tulane University had reports of finding fecal contamination in the community’s water system.</p>
  <p>In its own study of 20 randomly selected homes in Enterprise, Virginia Tech didn’t find any fecal contamination – however, it found dire levels of contamination for other harmful substances. Of the 20 homes surveyed, 16 homes exceeded the limit for disinfection by-products – a group of chemicals that include Chloroform, a substance which is a probable carcinogen and can be toxic if inhaled or swallowed, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/chloroform/default.html" target="_blank">CDC</a>.</p>
  <p>The study also found that three of the surveyed homes exceeded the EPA’s standard for lead levels, one home reaching nearly eight times the standard level. The report stated its concern over this finding, since the study conducted a random sampling and not a sampling directed towards homes high-risk, worst-case homes, which the EPA bases its standard on. This 20% detection rate of lead matches the same sampling found in Flint, Michigan.</p>
  <p>The high levels of lead shows that the communities’ pipes have corroded towards to a dire level.</p>
